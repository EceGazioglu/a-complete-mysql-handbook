# a-complete-mysql-handbook

### ABOUT PROJECT
  This project is a collection of SQL queries and techniques used to perform data analysis in MySQL. The handbook demonstrates various MySQL functionalities such as querying, joining tables, data filtering, and aggregation. The goal of this project is to showcase different SQL operations and their applications, providing a learning resource for anyone — starting from me — looking to improve their MySQL skills. All examples are created by me, and I am responsible for any errors.
